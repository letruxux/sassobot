# sassobot

old music bot

it worked, probably still works.
it was pretty cool, it's very old so do whatever you want w it
it uses unofficial external apis so it may stop working at anytime. just remember to update all packages frequently.

## install

```
> git clone https://github.com/letruxux/sassobot
> cd sassobot
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
